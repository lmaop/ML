# Bank Customer retirement predictions with age and 401k using SVM
Ml project using SVM <br>
learnings:<br>
1. Standard Scalar and min max Scalar boost accuracy <br>
2. C and gamma parameter can be messed around with in grid search to find the best pair and give better results <br>

Coming to the results: <br>
Many bank customers with higher age than 55 and 401k more than 600000 will retire<br>
the model has an accuracy of 95% and will predict better than above statement:p
